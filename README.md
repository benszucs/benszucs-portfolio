v.3

Portfolio website built from scratch to showcase all my hobby projects.

From wireframing, to hosting, I saw this project through in a matter of a few evenings.

Combined all of the useful technologies and techniques I have learned over the last year to create this fully responsive website, that shows potential employers as much concise information as possible, about me and my skills.
